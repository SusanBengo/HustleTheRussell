Create a Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab Notebook, or Amazon SageMaker Notebook to prepare a training and testing dataset.


 Optionally, apply a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model.


 Create one or more machine learning models.


 Fit the model(s) to the training data.


 Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.


 Show the predictions using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions if more than one model is used.


 Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.


 Use one new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric that hasn't been covered in class.


 Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
